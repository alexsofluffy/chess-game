![](chess.gif)<br>
A simple chess game you can play with a friend. The chess logic was coded in 
Python 3.8 and the UI with Pygame 2.0.0.dev6.

# Features
Supports all major special rules in chess, such as Promotion, En passant, 
Castling and Stalemates.

# Requirements
To run this game, you need Python 3.x and the Pygame plugin installed.
After downloading repository, simply run 'client.py'.

# Known Bugs
Code has been tested extensively so there should be nothing game breaking, but
please email me at alalex616@gmail.com if you find a bug and I'll do my best to
fix it.

# Pending Features
Game currently does not support under-promotion due to how rare it is. I may or
may not add this feature in a later update.
